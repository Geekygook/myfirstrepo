## Description

The **CGPA Calculator** is a console-based application built in **Java** that calculates a student's CGPA based on inputted course grades and their associated credit hours. The program uses a 4.0 GPA scale to calculate the weighted average of grades based on course credit hours.

It allows users to input the grades (e.g., A, B, C) for each course, along with the number of credit hours for that course. The program then computes the CGPA and displays it to the user.
